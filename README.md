## The following script for part a of this assignent is a working prototype that reads a single strand of DNA. The code valdiates the DNA sequence and converts any lowercase nucletoides to uppercase and omits invalid characters. It finds exact matches to the common promoter motifs of TTGACT and TATATT for -35 and -10 consensus sequences. Lastly, it reports an an output highlighting the consensus sequences and gives a match score based off of the base pairs in between the consensus sequences of 15-20 base pairs highlighting its efficiency as a promoter.
